## Project Overview
This project simulates and analyzes household electricity consumption data to provide detailed insights into hourly usage and associated costs. The data is processed and cleaned using Python (Pandas, NumPy), and interactive visualizations are created using Power BI.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy,Matplotlib)
- Power BI

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing of raw electricity usage CSV files.
- Calculation of hourly electricity consumption and cost estimation.
- Visualization of trends and usage patterns through Power BI dashboards.
- Export of processed data for further analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset contains simulated household electricity consumption data recorded hourly.  
**Note:** Sample CSV files are included in the repository for testing purposes.

## How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Install required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
3.Run the main Python script:
     -analyzer.py
4.Output files (processed CSV) will be generated in the output/ folder.

5.Open the Power BI dashboard file (Electricity Analyzer report.pbix) to explore visualizations.

Power BI Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard provides interactive charts and insights into electricity consumption patterns. You can view the dashboard by opening the .pbix file in Power BI.
